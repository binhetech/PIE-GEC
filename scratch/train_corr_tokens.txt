[CLS] My town is a medium - sized city with eighty thousand inhabitants . [SEP]
[CLS] It has a high - density population because of its small territory . [SEP]
[CLS] Although it is an industrial city , there are many shops and department stores . [SEP]
[CLS] I recommend visiting the artificial lake in the center of the city which is surrounded by a park . [SEP]
[CLS] Past ##eries are very common and most of them offer the special dessert of the city . [SEP]
[CLS] There is a commercial zone along the wide ##st street of the city where you can find all kinds of businesses : banks , bars , chemist ##s , cinemas , pet shops , restaurants , fast food restaurants , grocers , travel agencies , supermarket ##s and others . [SEP]
[CLS] Most of the shops have sales and offers in at least three months of the year : January , June and August . [SEP]
[CLS] The quality of the products and services is quite good , because there is huge competition . However , I recommend you be careful of fake ##s or cheat ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] Everyone has his own plans . [SEP]
[CLS] Some people want to be a doctor , others want to be a teacher . [SEP]
[CLS] Working as a journalist is very exciting for many reasons . [SEP]
[CLS] First , I will have an opportunity to live abroad . [SEP]
[CLS] Second , I can travel all around the world , and meet different people who are very friendly . [SEP]
[CLS] Next , I will have a chance to attend big parties or events and I can make friends with famous people . It ' s interesting ! [SEP]
[CLS] Finally , I will have a high salary when I am a journalist . [SEP]
[CLS] To be a journalist , I must study very hard , so I 'll try to learn in order to make my dream come true . [SEP]
[CLS] In the future , I 'll become a journalist . [SEP]
[CLS] Nowadays , each family has more than 1 car for each person , this is only one of several reasons why people use less public transport . [SEP]
[CLS] I remember to go from my town , Palermo , to Milan was about 340 pounds . Now , if we are lucky , we can get to New York . [SEP]
[CLS] In England , where I live , in Bedford , we use the train a lot to go to the most important towns in the UK , but the trains are very expensive . Me and my family are careful to go off peak because the prices are too high . [SEP]
[CLS] I 'm sure in the future there will be cars that are able to fly or you can park them in your pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] Furthermore , the biggest group of positive feeling students in the present is live with various national ##ities . [SEP]
[CLS] The possible reason is these international students can not speak English fluent ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] They usually lack language and can not start a debate . [SEP]
[CLS] It is restrict to argue . [SEP]
[CLS] On the other hand , they might want to safe ##guard the national image . [SEP]
[CLS] In order to give a good image and show the national parent ##ing , our respond ##ents tend to have a great pardon to other national ##ities . [SEP]
[CLS] More Than Keep fit ! [SEP]
[CLS] Do you know about mountain bi ##king ? [SEP]
[CLS] Perhaps you think it ' s only a sport . [SEP]
[CLS] You ' re wrong . [SEP]
[CLS] carry on reading to know why ! [SEP]
[CLS] I have been keen on mountain bi ##king since three years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] First , I tried it with a rental bike in the area of Aznalcazar . [SEP]
[CLS] The main reason why I wanted to try it was to lose weight ( I was a bit over ##weight ) . [SEP]
[CLS] However , it was wonderful how I could admire the landscape while I was doing sport . [SEP]
[CLS] Consequently , I realized that although cycling outside helped me to improve my fitness , really I enjoyed most breathing fresh air and taking pleasure in the countryside . [SEP]
[CLS] If someone wants to take up this sport , first of all , I would recommended him or her to look for a good mountain bike . [SEP]
[CLS] It ' s important to avoid accidents , be comfortable and have a good journey . [SEP]
[CLS] secondly , he or she should buy a good helmet and , of course , appropriate clothing . [SEP]
[CLS] I love this sport . I look forward to the weekend to go out with my bike and my group of friends . [SEP]
[CLS] All of us have a good time . [SEP]
[CLS] And I would like to encourage everybody to try it . [SEP]
[CLS] Nobody will regret it . [SEP]
[CLS] Lucy Key ##es [SEP]
[CLS] Lucy Key ##es was the last thriller I saw . [SEP]
[CLS] I do n't recommend it to children under thirteen years old , [SEP]
[CLS] because it ' s difficult to understand ; for example , the characters are , [SEP]
[CLS] Lucy , Molly , and their parents , a cowboy , and a teacher . [SEP]
[CLS] The movie is about Lucy ' s family , who move into a farmhouse that is mysterious and [SEP]
[CLS] scary . [SEP]
[CLS] Also reflects a comparison of Lucy ' s family , and characters [SEP]
[CLS] from a story their mom often reads . [SEP]
[CLS] The story actually takes place in a camp and a farmhouse , mysterious ##ly [SEP]
[CLS] used in other times . [SEP]
[CLS] It ' s interesting because Lucy ' s mom discovered a wall in their farm , that [SEP]
[CLS] had a weird painting of two sisters just like hers , and the same ones too as the [SEP]
[CLS] story she read . [SEP]
[CLS] I recommend this movie only to teenagers older than thirteen years old . . [SEP]
[CLS] The best place for young people in our area is without doubt the lake . [SEP]
[CLS] Here they can do many kinds of sport : swimming , sailing , surfing , kit ##ing , rowing and many others . [SEP]
[CLS] At least they can meet other folks and relax , sun ##bat ##he and listen to music . [SEP]
[CLS] In the summer around the lake , there are so many concerts that you have difficulty finding the right one . [SEP]
[CLS] Luckily , the schools are closed for ten weeks , so the young girls and boys have a lot of time to spend their [SEP]
[CLS] leisure time together . [SEP]
[CLS] Dear husband , [SEP]
[CLS] I hope you ' re fine . [SEP]
[CLS] I remember all of you and miss my family . [SEP]
[CLS] Leaving my country , Somalia , was very hard for me . [SEP]
[CLS] I miss my big house , but I do n't miss the guns . [SEP]
[CLS] I hope to return to my country and see you again . [SEP]
[CLS] In the following decades , revolution and civil wars s ##mote many of the Powers of Europe , and new nations were born . [SEP]
[CLS] Britain alone escaped almost unscathed from these years of unrest . [SEP]
[CLS] There was an unparalleled expansion of the English - Speaking Peoples both by birth and emigration . [SEP]
[CLS] I really like to travel , but I like it most when I travel with friends . [SEP]
[CLS] I a very good experience . [SEP]
[CLS] I love to travel with my family . [SEP]
[CLS] I do not travel so much with my friends . [SEP]
[CLS] I have only traveled two times . [SEP]
[CLS] Those two times were with the orchestra that I play in . [SEP]
[CLS] Once we went to Zacatecas . [SEP]
[CLS] We went there because the university orchestra from U ##A ##Z invited us to go there and play with them . [SEP]
[CLS] At that time , I did not know anybody , just one person . [SEP]
[CLS] Her name is i ##rix ##hi . [SEP]
[CLS] She was my friend , because we are from the same town . [SEP]
[CLS] But when I was there , I began to make new friends that I never thought I would have , and I never imagined the way that I was going to know them either . At the beginning , I felt very strange talking with them , but now we are very good friends . [SEP]
[CLS] We stayed in Zacatecas for a week . We really had a good time . [SEP]
[CLS] The second trip that I made was to Guerrero . [SEP]
[CLS] We went to to Acapulco to play , to an event where universities from Mexico go and present cultural activities . [SEP]
[CLS] It was too hot there . [SEP]
[CLS] In Acapulco I had a good time because I stayed in the same room as my friends and we swam a lot and we really had fun . [SEP]
[CLS] Then we went to Tax ##co . [SEP]
[CLS] There we visited the central park and we stayed in a very luxurious hotel . [SEP]
[CLS] We were very happy there . We really liked Tax ##co . [SEP]
[CLS] Actually , I had already been there before , but not with my friends . [SEP]
[CLS] Then we went to Cacahuamilpa to play there . That was an incredible experience that I will never forget . [SEP]
[CLS] Then we returned to To ##lu ##ca to continue with my boring life . [SEP]
[CLS] And now I have to pass my subjects . [SEP]
[CLS] We hope to go to Colombia next year . [SEP]
[CLS] I like bi ##ath ##lon . [SEP]
[CLS] Really , I think it ' s a very beautiful , interesting and breath ##taking kind of sport . [SEP]
[CLS] In bi ##ath ##lon , sports ##men need to run some races which are very different ; some of them are long , some are short . [SEP]
[CLS] Sometimes the weather conditions are not comfortable for guys . For example : wind , light fog or freezing temperatures . All of these are very difficult conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] So , it ' s not so easy as it seems . [SEP]
[CLS] That ' s why I like it . [SEP]
[CLS] This sport is for real men . [SEP]
[CLS] And also most of them are very attractive . A big advantage for girls , who like nice pictures . [SEP]
[CLS] There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient . [SEP]
[CLS] That is what everyone says when we ask if they prefer public transport or car . [SEP]
[CLS] Using public transport can be difficult , because we have a strict time and , normally , we do not have a place to sit and that can be extremely uncomfortable . [SEP]
[CLS] Sometimes the staff go on strike and we customers do not know in time . As a result , we can not get to work on time . That is one of the disadvantage ##s of using public transport . [SEP]
[CLS] One argument for not using the car is that petrol is very expensive , but public transport tickets are also increasing , so that advantage is not so good , actually . [SEP]
[CLS] For me , the car is the best . And you ? [SEP]
[CLS] Well , whatever your choice is , it must be perfect for your daily life ! [SEP]
[CLS] Whatever you use , have a nice trip ! [SEP]
[CLS] People usually tell me I 'm a cinema enthusiast , and they are right . I prefer to spend my free time watching a good film , especially when it is a thriller , rather than doing sport , [SEP]
[CLS] If you want to see a good thriller , " Reg ##ression " will be your best option . I have seen it recently and , in my opinion , it should be seen by everyone , because I believe people would like it for many reasons . [SEP]
[CLS] secondly , the actors were fantastic and the main character , who was played by Emma Watson ( who is really hi ##lar ##ious ) , was amazing . [SEP]
[CLS] What ' s more , the plot is easy to understand . [SEP]
[CLS] The story took place in the USA a few years ago when the re ##gression method was accepted by doctors and scientists . [SEP]
[CLS] In addition , the costumes , make - up and special effects the story . [SEP]
[CLS] However , the soundtrack was awful ; it did n't get having a scared . [SEP]
[CLS] In conclusion , my recommendation for the student film club is this f ##abulous and exciting thriller , which must be seen if you want to have a good time , given that it achieve ##s keeping you in su ##spense until the end and it does n't be afraid . [SEP]
[CLS] In addition , you wo n't have a better opportunity to see it than this week , because just now in Spain the cinema festival is taking place . [SEP]
[CLS] You should take advantage of that ! [SEP]
[CLS] In my opinion , public transport in my country will never improve , because my country is so poor and , besides , it is considered one of the Third World countries . And another thing that must be taken into consideration is that the politicians are horrible . They have destroyed my country . [SEP]
[CLS] When we ask ourselves how we can take care of the environment , [SEP]
[CLS] the first thing that we think of is the pollution , the car exhaust , factory smoke , etc . . . but , have we thought about food or clothes ? [SEP]
[CLS] Perhaps when we are shopping in the supermarket or other shops we are doing something bad , because we ask the assistant for a bag or something similar to carry this food or other things home . [SEP]
[CLS] We could bring a bag from our house , because if we do this every time that we are going to shop in each shop , we wo n't use more plastic or paper . [SEP]
[CLS] But we should n't forget the pollution cause by cars . We should use a bicycle or public transportation more . [SEP]
[CLS] Also , in the same way , we should walk to our destination . [SEP]
[CLS] If we are working with someone in the same job who lives near us or is our neighbour , we can go to work in the same car . This way we use less petrol . [SEP]
[CLS] The governments are also important for taking care of the environment . [SEP]
[CLS] They should have healthy habits and , by their example , they can improve the habits of the population . [SEP]
[CLS] I love sports but I do not get many opportunities to play a sport . I was born in a village in India . My parents are farmers like most other villagers . [SEP]
[CLS] The only playground in our village was the school ground which was full of small rocks and not good for playing any sports . [SEP]
[CLS] When I was a child I helped my father with his jobs after school . [SEP]
[CLS] We bought a television in 1888 . After that , I became a fan of cricket . [SEP]
[CLS] I watched most of the matches . [SEP]
[CLS] Sa ##chin and Gang ##ul ##y were my favorite cricketer ##s . I love their batting . [SEP]
[CLS] A mistake [SEP]
[CLS] It was the summer holidays and Michael ' s family were at the airport waiting impatiently for their flight to Mexico . [SEP]
[CLS] That was a special family ; it was so big . His father has 6 brothers , so he has 17 cousins and his little sister . [SEP]
[CLS] In total , there were 32 people , a white kit ##ten and a dog . [SEP]
[CLS] About 10 minutes later , they were starting to get bored , when they heard a girl calling them to board the plane . [SEP]
[CLS] The flight to Mexico was incredible , and very funny . [SEP]
[CLS] Michael usually had a great time with his cousins , except with Tom . [SEP]
[CLS] That was because Tom liked to give orders to everyone , and Michel did n't like that . [SEP]
[CLS] When the big family got off the plane , they realized that they were wearing too many clothes ; it was boiling ! ! [SEP]
[CLS] Then they took a taxi to the hotel , and at 4 pm , [SEP]
[CLS] the family was walking around the luxurious hotel . [SEP]
[CLS] Some minutes later , they designated how the cousins were going to share the rooms . [SEP]
[CLS] Michael finally ended up with the last one he would like to share with ; Tom . [SEP]
[CLS] That night , the dog , the kit ##ten , Tom and Michel slept in the same room , and that was n't too bad . [SEP]
[CLS] When Michael got up in the morning , he realized that his kit ##tten had disappeared , and he found Tom ' s dog with some white hair in his mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] He thought that the dog had eaten the kit ##ten during the night , so he shouted at Tom , opened the door and went away . [SEP]
[CLS] Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake . [SEP]
[CLS] One of the best restaurants I 've ever been to is Spizharka . [SEP]
[CLS] It is situated in the very centre of our city and offers a wide variety of dishes and drinks . [SEP]
[CLS] The service is really great . [SEP]
[CLS] The waitress ##es are helpful and smiling . [SEP]
[CLS] You feel like you are at home ! [SEP]
[CLS] Warm candle ##light and small tables with pattern ##ed table cloth ##s create a friendly atmosphere . [SEP]
[CLS] The dishes are n't very expensive . [SEP]
[CLS] I believe it is suitable for our class [SEP]
[CLS] So , my favourite sport at the present time is street work ##out . I have been doing this sport for a long time already . [SEP]
[CLS] I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside is below zero . [SEP]
[CLS] Of course , in summer , I like to exercise more than in winter , but this does n't stop me . [SEP]
[CLS] If it is very cold and wind outside , I do n't worry about it and I exercise at home . [SEP]
[CLS] For those people who want to start to do the street work ##out , I advise you to start with basic exercises such as pull ups , push ups , dip ##s and sq ##ua ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] These are all basic exercises and they will help you make a good start . [SEP]
[CLS] After some time , when you feel that you are ready for more , you can start to do more difficult exercises . [SEP]
[CLS] So , it ' s my first attempt to create English text ! [SEP]
[CLS] I was quite self - confident a few months ago . [SEP]
[CLS] But not now . [SEP]
[CLS] What ' s the reason ? [SEP]
[CLS] Because of mind . [SEP]
[CLS] I was n't satisfied with your behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] Sometimes , a lot of phrases and sentences run around my head , but how to write them down correctly ? [SEP]
[CLS] How can I use it ? [SEP]
[CLS] How can I force my kids to do their homework ? [SEP]
[CLS] How can I explain to them ? [SEP]
[CLS] Michael is a handsome and kind person . [SEP]
[CLS] He lives next to his family ' s home . [SEP]
[CLS] Michael got married to his close friend only one month ago . [SEP]
[CLS] But his mother hated his wife and always shouted at her . [SEP]
[CLS] In contrast , his wife respected and loved his mother and never complained to her husband about these bad situations . [SEP]
[CLS] Michael ' s only fault is that he is a ma ##mma ' s boy . [SEP]
[CLS] Because of this , he always defended his mother and always said the wife was the one responsible . [SEP]
[CLS] His wife decided , because she loved him , to forgive and apologize to her mother - in - law . [SEP]
[CLS] One day when Michael was out at work , his mother insulted and hit his wife . [SEP]
[CLS] Moreover , she fired her without her mobile or money . [SEP]
[CLS] His wife was sad and she cried a lot and she stood in the street waiting for Michael . [SEP]
[CLS] When he came , his mother asked him to up quickly , pretending that she was tired . [SEP]
[CLS] He saw his wife but said no words to her and continued on his way . [SEP]
[CLS] His wife walked behind him until they reached home but his mother claimed that his wife said cruel words to her and pretended that she was crying . [SEP]
[CLS] Michael believed his mother , although he observed bruises on his wife ' s face . [SEP]
[CLS] He fired his wife after insulting her . [SEP]
[CLS] She was shocked and apologized for a mistake she did not commit . [SEP]
[CLS] But his mother refused her apology and ordered him to close the door . [SEP]
[CLS] Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake . [SEP]
[CLS] The light bulb . [SEP]
[CLS] The light bulb was created in 1879 by Thomas Al ##va Edison . [SEP]
[CLS] This was one of the everyday inventions that affects our lives . [SEP]
[CLS] Edison is said to have created the first commercially practical incandescent light . [SEP]
[CLS] He was neither the first nor the only person trying to in ##vent an incandescent light bulb . [SEP]
[CLS] Some historians claim there were 20 other inventor ##s of incandescent lamps prior to Edison ' s version , but Edison is often credited with the invention because his version was able to outs ##tri ##p the earlier versions because of a combination of three factors : " an effective incandescent material , a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable . " [SEP]
[CLS] ( taken from www . bulb ##s . com ) [SEP]
[CLS] Edison began serious research into the incandescent light bulb in October of 1878 , and his original design was in 1879 . [SEP]
[CLS] Edison and his research team made his discovery commercially and create a company called " Edison Electric Light Company " . [SEP]
[CLS] I think what this is the most useful invention because without this we ca n't live like we live these days . [SEP]
[CLS] Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately . [SEP]
[CLS] Tom , a friend of Peter ' s suddenly faint ##ed and fell down in the class room . I did n't know what to do immediately . First , I calmed myself down and I checked his pulse . It was okay . Then I knew that he was out of danger , so I called my classmates . Everyone came rushing to the spot , but still he was not moving , so we decided to take him to the hospital or call an ambulance . Finally we called an ambulance without delay . [SEP]
[CLS] Everyone was eagerly waiting for the ambulance ' s arrival , but it still had not yet reached us . The reason was our college location is quite far from the city . That ' s why it was late . [SEP]
[CLS] We were waiting patiently . Finally , the ambulance arrived and took him to the hospital immediately . [SEP]
[CLS] Recently I saw a very interesting announcement in International Sports Monthly magazine . [SEP]
[CLS] I was interested in whether I could write such an article and win a prize . [SEP]
[CLS] And I decided to try . [SEP]
[CLS] Nowadays , a healthy way of life is very popular with most people all over the world . [SEP]
[CLS] And as for me , I 've been going in for sport for several years . [SEP]
[CLS] What is my favourite kind of sport ? [SEP]
[CLS] It ' s ordinary body ##building . [SEP]
[CLS] Why did I choose it ? [SEP]
[CLS] I want to be fit and have good health . [SEP]
[CLS] I lost several k ##ilo ##s and I could wear my favourite clothes . [SEP]
[CLS] It became possible for me to run easily . [SEP]
[CLS] I ' d like to give advice to everybody not to sit at home and watch TV . [SEP]
[CLS] Go to sports centres and gym ##s , be active and you will feel different . [SEP]
[CLS] You will forget about doctors and expensive medicine . [SEP]
[CLS] Sport is like drugs . [SEP]
[CLS] If you do n't have exercise for a long time , your body will feel something unusual . [SEP]
[CLS] Your muscles will be strong and you 'll be able to do any difficult job . [SEP]
[CLS] People will look at your figure en ##vious ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] describe your bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] My bedroom is quite big . [SEP]
[CLS] The walls of my bedroom are white and the floor is dark grey . [SEP]
[CLS] In my bedroom there is a brown bed , a yellow chest of drawers , a little light brown bedside table and a big brown wardrobe . [SEP]
[CLS] On the wall there are some pictures of my family , but I do n't have any posters . [SEP]
[CLS] I live in São Carlos , in the countryside of São Paulo , in Brazil . [SEP]
[CLS] In my city , protecting the environment is so difficult . [SEP]
[CLS] First of all , we have an extinction area of c ##er ##rado close to the Federal University of São Carlos , but sometimes , the area is used to construct a new university building . [SEP]
[CLS] We have done several movements , but sometimes it has not worked . [SEP]
[CLS] secondly , the council does n't care about the environment ; for example , the council stopped the garbage collection when the new mayor took over the council . [SEP]
[CLS] It demonstrated that the effort that was made in the last 10 years was over because of the new political position of the mayor . [SEP]
[CLS] It is so stupid because the environment needs to be more important than political positions . [SEP]
[CLS] Third , we have not founded a green policy to eliminate rub ##bish . [SEP]
[CLS] Instead of using selective collection of garbage , or recycling of materials , or a sa ##ni ##tary land ##fill , we have used a dump ##fill that is con ##tam ##inating the soil . [SEP]
[CLS] Finally , the population , most of the time , does n't matter to throw away garbage on the street or in a prohibited area . [SEP]
[CLS] In conclusion , in my city , concern for the environment ' s protection is not working as it should for the protection of soil , environment and health . [SEP]
[CLS] The environment is our surroundings . There is no awareness in our locality . They are busy with their own work . No one focuses on or sees what is happening in our town . They usually speak about how hot it is today , but they do n't know what makes it this hot . I am interested in planting trees and making our surroundings clean . Some people used to burn the forest as if the forest is useless . Man is greedy because all the things we get from the forests are free . [SEP]
[CLS] They do n't care about the environment because it does n't give anything to them . [SEP]
[CLS] Management accounting practice is very important for an organization for making decisions about human resources , sales , marketing and potential customers . [SEP]
[CLS] Most organizations know how management accounting practice affects their work . Therefore , they choose good programmes and employees . [SEP]
[CLS] I was in the USA last year , first in order to look for a job as a pharmacist , but also , having a lot of time to explore a new world . [SEP]
[CLS] I spent about two years there , but I wanted to come back to Italy because I missed my home . [SEP]
[CLS] At first , I called a travel agent but he said he would n't be able to book me a flight for two months , so I called my brother who heavily regret me for not having told him about the trip , and he told me he would book a flight sooner than that good - for - nothing travel agent . [SEP]
[CLS] I believed him , but I did n't know how wrong I was . [SEP]
[CLS] He booked me the flight but he did n't pay for it , because at that moment he had n't got enough cash on him . [SEP]
[CLS] The worst thing was finding that out at the airport . [SEP]
[CLS] I had never felt so nervous ! [SEP]
[CLS] The environment is always a hurting problem in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] There are company so much , they , they make our life poll ##uted . [SEP]
[CLS] To take care of the environment , each of us has to do something such as propaganda to the people in the country . About my village , we use banana leaves instead of n ##ylon , di ##sp ##ose of garbage se ##ns ##ibly . . . and so on . [SEP]
[CLS] Hi , today I 'm go ##n na talk about myself . [SEP]
[CLS] My name is A ##bra ##r sa ##eed Al - m ##uba ##rak . [SEP]
[CLS] I ' m 13 years old . [SEP]
[CLS] I live in Saudi Arabia ( R ##iya ##dh ) , and I 'm in grade nine . [SEP]
[CLS] I have 9 sisters , with me we are 10 girls , and 9 brothers . [SEP]
[CLS] I really love learning English language & French language and Spanish language , and I speak Arabic . [SEP]
[CLS] My dear Daniel , [SEP]
[CLS] Are you studying mathematics for your exam ? [SEP]
[CLS] I hope you pass it with a good grade ! [SEP]
[CLS] I have just finished my lunch break , and before preparing everything to go to work , I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a little surprise with these fantastic photos . I hope you like them . [SEP]
[CLS] With all my love [SEP]
[CLS] Victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] Dear Sir or Mad ##am [SEP]
[CLS] I would like to apply for the job that you have advertised . [SEP]
[CLS] I 'm a happy , energetic person who likes to work with children . [SEP]
[CLS] I love young children . [SEP]
[CLS] I have worked in many kitchen ##s before , and I have gained a lot of experience there . [SEP]
[CLS] Bye [SEP]
[CLS] Maris ##a [SEP]
[CLS] This summer several things happened to me . I went to the beach , I went to the pool , or simply went for a walk with friends , but the best thing was when I went to a wedding , because it was the event that brought me the most memories this summer . [SEP]
[CLS] We got there at five o ' clock . We had not yet reached many people , so we took the opportunity to give the gift , which was a washing machine the finished clothing to reach the store , and apparently they were in need of a new one , as the bride loved . [SEP]
[CLS] Half an hour after we arrived , everybody started arriving , there were many greeting ##s , thanks , hug ##s , kisses , and then we all went to the table , which was magnificent ##ly stock ##ed , with plenty of food of all kinds , drinks , but we were all waiting for the main course . Also , the food was magnificent , but the best part was when the couple went to the pool . We were lucky they had an amazing wedding plan ##ner who arranged magnificent and fun activities . He said to the bride and groom that they should each get into an inflatable ball and try walking on the water for as long as they could , and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them , out of the ball , fell into the water , and kissed . [SEP]
[CLS] At four in the morning , after opening the presents , everyone started to leave . It was a long day and a lot of fun , but it could have lasted a bit longer . [SEP]
[CLS] I usually wake up at six o ' clock in the morning , then I take a quick shower . [SEP]
[CLS] After school , I like to eat fresh fruit . [SEP]
[CLS] I am keen on running during the night time . [SEP]
[CLS] In my country people make a lot of mistakes and have a lot of bad habits concerning their attitude towards rub ##bish . They are always throwing their old things and rub ##bish away in public places . The government also can not do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour . [SEP]
[CLS] Once upon a time , there was a monster in a city called " Michenstain " . [SEP]
[CLS] Michenstain was a very tiny city . That was one bad thing for them ; the other bad thing was that in the city , there was a monster called " Monster ##ation " . [SEP]
[CLS] Monster ##ation was a very lively monster . He always migrated to the north every Monday . [SEP]
[CLS] In the day , he was a mild monster , he was very visible ( because he was big ) ; but in the night , he was the opposite . He killed people , destroyed complete cities ; he smashed all the architecture of the city , and did a lot of bad things . [SEP]
[CLS] One day , Monster ##ation ' s next destination was the city of Michenstain . [SEP]
[CLS] None of the people knew what that was , so they did n't care about it . [SEP]
[CLS] But when he arrived in Michenstain , all the people went : " DAHMMMMMMMMMM " . [SEP]
[CLS] So all the people started to run and scream , and the monster was pursuing all of them . [SEP]
[CLS] He was s ##po ##iling all the people ' s crops , he was destroying all the vehicles , and he destroyed a vast area . [SEP]
[CLS] The next day , he was a very attractive monster . In other words , he was undercover in another monster ' s body . [SEP]
[CLS] He was completely different ; it was impressive the way he was acting . [SEP]
[CLS] The thing that he ( the monster ) did n't know about was that he had a spectacular infection ( literally spectacular ) that I think had no cure . It was called " The Monster ##ation infections " . [SEP]
[CLS] ( In those times , there were diverse monsters , but none of them was like him ; he was the number 1 of the monsters at destroying things . ) [SEP]
[CLS] Scientists were trying to find a cure for the Monster ##ation infections , but they still do n't have it . [SEP]
[CLS] In their laboratories , they had a lot of chemicals that were prohibited in their country , but they used them . [SEP]
[CLS] They had to is ##olate the chemicals to find the formula to have the cure . [SEP]
[CLS] Some scientists did n't care about the infection ; they were playing ultimate team on their i ##P ##ods . [SEP]
[CLS] The scientists that were making the formula had a lot of tension , but finally , they did it and they said : " magnificent " . [SEP]
[CLS] Well I ' d like to talk to you about my experiences as an English student for many years . [SEP]
[CLS] I 'm 56 years old and I 'm a chemist . [SEP]
[CLS] I have needed to use English a lot of times during my professional activities . For that reason I took some English lessons many years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] I can tell you that I feel I can understand over 90 % when I 'm listening and when I 'm reading , but my main problem with English is , of course , when I have to speak . I fee terrible and without confidence . I think that I 'm always thinking in Spanish and then doing the translation into English . Maybe at this moment , while I 'm writing this composition , I 'm making the same mistake . I know that learning English is a long process , but I must follow that process because I ' d like to be an excellent bilingual person . [SEP]
[CLS] Currently , I 'm working as a teacher at the university and teaching in English is my goal . [SEP]
[CLS] I 'm a teacher of chemistry and math too . [SEP]
[CLS] I also work as a freelance worker with the same subjects because it is necessary to increase my income . [SEP]
[CLS] I 'm writing now without using a dictionary and doing this composition without translating from Spanish ( I hope ha ##ha ##ha ) [SEP]
[CLS] I 'm sure I 'll have made many mistakes , but I feel good because I must write and write and write . I need to improve my English level . I must not feel bad if I want to finally learn English very well . [SEP]
[CLS] I hope you can help me understand more about how to improve my English level and develop my skills . [SEP]
[CLS] Thank you for your attention , and I 'll wait for your advice , ( this is my first time writing over 50 words ) [SEP]
[CLS] Milton Morales [SEP]
[CLS] I like to work out on push up bars . [SEP]
[CLS] It is impossible not to love doing sports activity in the fresh air . [SEP]
[CLS] If you want to start working out , you should be ready for a big load on your muscles . [SEP]
[CLS] On Thursday , September 11 , the term exams finished and our week of vacation started . [SEP]
[CLS] In the afternoon , I went to my dance classes . [SEP]
[CLS] It was fun because we learnt a new hip hop dance and we finished our tap dance . [SEP]
[CLS] On Friday I went to the mall with my family . [SEP]
[CLS] I bought one sweater and two pairs of jeans . [SEP]
[CLS] Later I went to the book store and bought three books ; " Legend " , " Wonder " , and " Eleanor & Park " . [SEP]
[CLS] On the weekend I stayed at home . I started reading " Eleanor & Park " ; it was amazing . I laughed a lot because of the things that the characters said . [SEP]
[CLS] The other things I did were sleep , eat , and watch TV . [SEP]
[CLS] The next day , I went with my friends to see a movie . [SEP]
[CLS] We saw " If I stay " and I loved it . [SEP]
[CLS] The movie is about a teenager named Mia who had a car accident with her family . [SEP]
[CLS] Her father and her mother died before they got to the hospital . [SEP]
[CLS] Mia survived but she is in a coma and she has to decide if she wants to live without her mother and father or if she wants to die . [SEP]
[CLS] Later in the week , I spent the day drawing . [SEP]
[CLS] I drew a meadow , a little girl , and a butterfly . [SEP]
[CLS] The next few days I did n't do much . [SEP]
[CLS] I just slept and watched movies at home . [SEP]
[CLS] The day before I started school , I did an investigation for literature class . [SEP]
[CLS] This was what I did in my vacation . I did n't do a lot but I loved my vacation . [SEP]
[CLS] Hello Jo , my name is Mir ##ko . [SEP]
[CLS] I 'm from Mr ##amo ##rak . [SEP]
[CLS] Serbia is my country where I have been living for 24 years . [SEP]
[CLS] If you would like and wish to come here my best advice is to stay at home . [SEP]
[CLS] Maybe you can bring some money and spend it on something fun . [SEP]
[CLS] Best wishes . [SEP]
[CLS] Mir ##ko . [SEP]
[CLS] As per today ' s topic , " No Future for public transport " , I would like to add comments on that . Please be patient , as my English is not as good as you readers think . [SEP]
[CLS] Most of the Metro cities are nowadays attract city - dwell ##ers towards the Metro , not only because of the fare , but because of the time that it saves . [SEP]
[CLS] Nowadays , the public do not like to travel on public transport to save time as well as money . [SEP]
[CLS] The Metro is even good for the health of the people as there is no pollution because it runs on electricity and it also connects most of the city . As Delhi has a wide area span of Metro that is really awesome . [SEP]
[CLS] Other than that , public transport is also not good for natural resources , which is not good for the future of the country . [SEP]
[CLS] If you visit Taiwan , you ca n't miss the temples here . [SEP]
[CLS] There are so many temples here . [SEP]
[CLS] So , now there is a chance for you to play the god . [SEP]
[CLS] Ji ##u - T ##ian Folk Arts Group is a group of people who are good at our traditional performance , which is " im ##itating the faces and posing as gods " . [SEP]
[CLS] Here , they will teach you how to draw the face of god , dance like god , and beat the drum . [SEP]
[CLS] curious ? [SEP]
[CLS] Just come and give it a try ! [SEP]
[CLS] I think paying expensive taxes on personal cars could reduce the use of cars or other vehicles in order to solve the traffic problems . [SEP]
[CLS] Because all people like money , for example , many people do n't buy a car with expensive tax , so people have to use public transportation , such as buses , the subway , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] Public transportation will rich , so we can build more stations for suburban and more public car to carry this . [SEP]
[CLS] Therefore , the traffic will be better . [SEP]
[CLS] Dear Sir / Mad ##am [SEP]
[CLS] I am applying for the position in the USA Summer camps to work this year . [SEP]
[CLS] I am 29 years old , and originally from Brazil . [SEP]
[CLS] I am an English student and I have been studying for five years , and recently , I passed the FC ##E , which is a well recognised certificate . [SEP]
[CLS] In 2010 , I graduated in electronic engineering . [SEP]
[CLS] From June to September of 2013 , I worked for a tourism company . My position involved looking after groups of people going to England . This previous experience makes me suitable for the job advertised . [SEP]
[CLS] In addition to this , personally I am really helpful , exciting , cheerful and committed . [SEP]
[CLS] I do sports such as football , basketball and chess , and with these skills , I could help children have fun while teaching them all the benefits of doing sport . [SEP]
[CLS] In applying for the job offered , I am willing to work in all different sorts of jobs . I do not mind which , as long as I have the opportunity of being in the USA , as English is my passion . [SEP]
[CLS] To sum up , I feel rather confident to assume this position and thank you for considering my application . [SEP]
[CLS] Yours faithful ##ly , [SEP]
[CLS] Alessandro Costa . [SEP]
[CLS] I think public transport is very important . [SEP]
[CLS] There is no way to travel from Egypt to the USA using a car . [SEP]
[CLS] A plane may take about 16 hours . [SEP]
[CLS] A car may take days or months for the same distance . [SEP]
[CLS] I am really overwhelmed to be the third member of my small family - Peter , Maria , both of whom are my parents of 45 years of age and my little brother , Patrick - 14 years old in a mischievous manner . [SEP]
[CLS] Their gentle norm with lovely and adorable minds are a reference to their ho ##bb ##ies - reading . [SEP]
[CLS] Nowadays a person ' s worth seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions . This mostly happens in high class families , as they focus on achievements like power , political influence etc . On the other hand , for middle class families the old - fashioned values are still important as they are inherited from our ancestors in terms of values like honesty , kindness , loyalty , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] The metro is the most comfortable means of transportation in Moscow . [SEP]
[CLS] The metro is the only one that I use in the city . [SEP]
[CLS] Using over ##ground transportation is not comfortable because of the traffic . [SEP]
[CLS] Just a few years ago , we started to use a special road line . [SEP]
[CLS] But the problem is , Russian drivers are not used to keeping this line free . [SEP]
[CLS] Moscow traffic is awful . [SEP]
[CLS] Everyone is in a hurry . [SEP]
[CLS] There is no difference if you use a car or the bus . [SEP]
[CLS] For example , American public transport has a special line and a schedule and it works like a train . I mean it comes at an exact time , like a train . [SEP]
[CLS] That ' s my dream " when I joined the faculty of languages and translation I was very happy because I had achieved my dream . [SEP]
[CLS] In this faculty , I faced some problems with my English . I began to ask " How can I improve my English ? " [SEP]
[CLS] all of the answers were , " you have to listen and read so you can write and speak well " . I said okay I have to depend on myself . I began to join groups on Facebook where I found some of the people shared their knowledge with others . I followed them immediately . [SEP]
[CLS] I am on my way to improving my English . I ask Allah to guide me to the right way . [SEP]
[CLS] My dream is that I want to open a Center for Language Learning , [SEP]
[CLS] to teach children and adults in my country good English , and I want to avoid traditional education . [SEP]
[CLS] The best thing that can encourage me to open this center is that I have 5 friends in my country who study in the faculty of languages and translation and I think that they will be very happy about joining me in my center . [SEP]
[CLS] I know that is a really amazing dream , but I pray to Allah to give me all the means to achieve my future dream . [SEP]
[CLS] Alex , I and my friends are going to the cinema at the weekend . [SEP]
[CLS] Would you like to join us ? [SEP]
[CLS] We are going to see an action movie . [SEP]
[CLS] If you want to join us , we can meet in Ambasodor mall in the city at 7 p . m . [SEP]
[CLS] Public transport has no future . The crisis in 2008 has reduced oil prices , The oil is cheap now and new cars are more efficient and the government give incentives for consumers . [SEP]
[CLS] One day in October , Michael , a boy who was studying architecture discovered a box with a message . While he was opening the box , he heard a door open . [SEP]
[CLS] At that moment , a big man came into the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] This man was his father , who was dead . [SEP]
[CLS] Michael was very agitated and confused because he did n't understand anything . [SEP]
[CLS] He spoke with his father and he asked him why he was there , and his father replied that he had the biggest secret about his family . [SEP]
[CLS] " In the past , Mat ##ilde , your mother , killed your brother , but she had a reason . He was a monster because he killed a lot of people in our city , so we went to another city . " [SEP]
[CLS] But Michael did not believe this story and he thought that he was crazy . [SEP]
[CLS] This situation was impossible because his father was dead and , at that moment , he ran and opened the door and his father said " You must stay here , because I must speak with you more and explain why I can speak with you " . But Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake . [SEP]
[CLS] Dear Mrs Ash ##by , [SEP]
[CLS] I want to work in your cafe . [SEP]
[CLS] I like a lot of food and drink . [SEP]
[CLS] I worked in a cafe last year in my country . I can work long hours . [SEP]
[CLS] Since ##rel ##y , [SEP]
[CLS] Tracy [SEP]
[CLS] How are you ? [SEP]
[CLS] Today we received a shipment from Visual service center under our old account number . It could be a mistake by the service center as a notice regarding major organizational rest ##ru ##cture has already been sent to service centers . [SEP]
[CLS] In the issued notice , it clearly states that all defect ##ive parts should be sent to Slovakia with effect from 01 / 06 / 2015 . [SEP]
[CLS] So , please advise all service centers to return defect ##ive parts to Slovakia instead of England . [SEP]
[CLS] Nowadays , sport is a very important part of our life . [SEP]
[CLS] Many doctors recommend the practicing of sport , because it is very healthy for our bodies and for our minds . [SEP]
[CLS] Every day , there are many articles and news items that talk about the benefits that you get if you p ##rac ##tise sport . [SEP]
[CLS] My favourite sport is swimming , because as soon as you start this sport , you feel better . [SEP]
[CLS] Even if you do n't lose weight , you can gain endurance and flexibility . [SEP]
[CLS] When I am in water , I feel free and very hastily . [SEP]
[CLS] Not only is sport when you feel sweaty , but you also do a lot of exercise . [SEP]
[CLS] However , you do n't have the feeling that you are very tired . It is different , at the same time , it is fantastic ! [SEP]
[CLS] My advice that I would give to someone starting my favourite sport , swimming , is that you need a little will ##power , because sometimes , for example in winter , you will not want to go to the gym , let alone get in a pool ! [SEP]
[CLS] My other advice is that I am absolutely sure that you will feel wonderful and happy ! May be not the first time , but definitely later . [SEP]
[CLS] I promise you that it will be this way . [SEP]
[CLS] Start and then you can explain to me how you are . [SEP]

[CLS] I watch a few TV - series , but I watch them on the internet , so I am not trying to time the clock to see an episode . [SEP]
[CLS] I like the restaurant we ate at when we were on a ski - vacation in Champoluc . [SEP]
[CLS] Hi , my name is Elliot and I like TV games and Le ##go . [SEP]
[CLS] I also like to speak English but I ca n't speak it at home because my little brother just says " stop talking English " when I speak English . [SEP]

[CLS] Hi Daniel , [SEP]
[CLS] How are you ? I am going to describe myself so you will be able to recognize me when we meet at the train station . [SEP]
[CLS] I am tall , around 2 meters , with black hair and blue eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] I will be wearing a white T - shirt and yellow shorts . [SEP]
[CLS] I will be at the train station at 7 o ' clock and I will be waiting for you at gate number seven . [SEP]
[CLS] Kind regards , [SEP]
[CLS] Rafael [SEP]
[CLS] I would like to describe my brother Rishabh Ban ##t ##wal in this letter . [SEP]
[CLS] He is 24 years old and he looks very similar to me . [SEP]
[CLS] He likes to play guitar in his free time and likes to go out with friends . [SEP]
[CLS] Nowadays , we are in the age of the internet . [SEP]
[CLS] A flat world is created by the internet . [SEP]
[CLS] We can get knowledge more easily and we learn more easily , too . [SEP]
[CLS] This is the power of information technology . [SEP]
[CLS] The social networks , such as Facebook , Twitter , In ##sta ##gram , Google plus . . . are connecting us to more and more friends , companies , public figures , books , films , social organizations . . . . We really have a lot of things to see , to think , to " like " , to " comment " on and dozens of other ways that we can make an action to interact with others . So , maybe it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves , to take care of our health . [SEP]
[CLS] They help us to communication with the world and we have only twenty hours a day . We know more things but we lose more time for many other interesting things . [SEP]
[CLS] But it just happen in the information technology and related fields such as : communication . [SEP]
[CLS] On the other hand , we still have a lot of other technologies to create a lot of useful machines , on - side services to make our life better and better day by day . [SEP]
[CLS] Transportation helps us go abroad more quickly , even go into space on a tour . [SEP]
[CLS] It is amazing for you , if you have enough money , to pay for that tour . [SEP]
[CLS] We feel more happy , comfortable and refreshed after something like that . [SEP]
[CLS] Biotechnology gives us more food . [SEP]
[CLS] Chemistry gives us more tablets . [SEP]
[CLS] Yes , we are solving many problems with our technology for our feeling , our health and our finances , too . [SEP]
[CLS] You can join any stock market in the world to buy some Google stocks and sell some Facebook stocks too , and earn some money . [SEP]
[CLS] You take the world in your hands with technology to make your life better and better actually , but it is not full that it will good , let keep it with your needs , your time and your money too . [SEP]
[CLS] How can I help the environment ? [SEP]
[CLS] How can a group of friends help the environment ? [SEP]
[CLS] This year me and my friends are going to help Pa ##rque Co ##rgo from the recent forest fire . [SEP]
[CLS] We are worried that if the trees do n't get planted soon they will never grow again . [SEP]
[CLS] That is the reason why we are going to plant 1000 trees there . [SEP]
[CLS] Public transport has improved regional development in the past decade . It ' s convenient and necessary for city life . [SEP]
[CLS] But when it comes to travelling , it 'll be more convenient if you have a car , because you will not want to go where everybody goes . [SEP]
[CLS] If you have a car , you can go anywhere you want and stop by any beautiful spot you like . [SEP]
[CLS] It ' s more flexible for your travel plan . [SEP]
[CLS] And , there ' s really enough development on our planet . It would be better if we could leave some place empty , we do n't need so much convenient transportation , and we can still live well . [SEP]
[CLS] Save some nature for the earth , and leave clean air for our kids . [SEP]
[CLS] build public transport in a city , not in the country . [SEP]
[CLS] My favorite sport is Cricket . [SEP]
[CLS] It is a very important and very enjoyable game . [SEP]
[CLS] Today , cricket is a very famous game in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] Cricket is very famous in Sri Lanka . [SEP]
[CLS] We could go to in the world from cricket . [SEP]
[CLS] It is really great . [SEP]
[CLS] Today we have clever ##er cricketer ##s and more famous umpire ##s than other countries . [SEP]
[CLS] It is very valuable . [SEP]
[CLS] Australia , England , South Africa and New Zealand are very famous countries for cricket . [SEP]
[CLS] But those countries are very developed and they have many facilities . [SEP]
[CLS] But Sri Lanka is a developing country still . [SEP]
[CLS] We have no facilities like other countries . [SEP]
[CLS] But Sri Lanka ' s cricket team won the World Cup in 2014 . [SEP]
[CLS] It is very important opportunities in our country . [SEP]
[CLS] So I think I can enjoy cricket more than other games . [SEP]
[CLS] You can start playing cricket game . [SEP]
[CLS] And you can earn more money and you can go to other countries . [SEP]
[CLS] Today we have lots of sports . [SEP]
[CLS] Volleyball , net ##ball , Elle , table tennis , Kara ##te , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] But they are not famous and we ca n't go to everywhere in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] But cricket is very famous and we know many cricketer ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] We can be famous and earn more money . [SEP]
[CLS] Cricket is better for our health than other games . [SEP]
[CLS] In my opinion , cricket is best for you . You could be a good cricketer . [SEP]
[CLS] You do not what to do ? [SEP]
[CLS] Are you a tourist ? [SEP]
[CLS] Are you lost in the city without knowing what to do ? [SEP]
[CLS] If I am right , continue reading this . [SEP]
[CLS] We have a lot of shopping facilities , that is the good thing about living in a big city like Madrid , because we have a lot of different shops including clothes shops , pet shops , food shops , shoe shops , access ##ory shops , toy shops , present shops and any more types of shops that now I can not remember , but you can find almost all you want or you need . Is n't it incredible ? [SEP]
[CLS] But for some of them you have to search very thoroughly because some of the shops are unique and some others are very well hidden , but for that you have specialized transport that will take you to wherever you want or you need to go . [SEP]
[CLS] Hi , [SEP]
[CLS] You wo n't believe what I did last month ! [SEP]
[CLS] I worked backstage at a rock concert ! [SEP]
[CLS] It was such a great experience for me . [SEP]
[CLS] I applied to a music club in our city and I was really excited when they replied and asked me to help , because I enjoy going to rock concerts and I was truly curious about how the backstage works . [SEP]
[CLS] What was my job ? [SEP]
[CLS] Mostly I helped others and carried stuff . [SEP]
[CLS] I enjoyed working with a sound ##master so far . [SEP]
[CLS] It was quite stress ##ful but at the end of the concert the atmosphere was amazing . [SEP]
[CLS] People were singing and shouting - they all seemed to be really happy . [SEP]
[CLS] I hope I will do that again sometime . [SEP]
[CLS] See you around [SEP]
[CLS] Steve [SEP]
[CLS] Hi Jo , [SEP]
[CLS] It ' s really nice that you are asking me about it . [SEP]
[CLS] Poland is really beautiful and you choose it wise ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] I suggest that you can start your trip from Warsaw . [SEP]
[CLS] It ' s the heart of Poland and you will learn everything about work , education and people here . [SEP]
[CLS] Every big city in Poland is very similar to the others . [SEP]
[CLS] If you want to relax you can also go to the mountains or sea . [SEP]
[CLS] Even there , you can meet really nice people and talk with them . [SEP]
[CLS] But let ' s talk about working there . [SEP]
[CLS] We appreciate kind and hard - working people . [SEP]
[CLS] But you ca n't expect that they are going to pay you a lot of money . [SEP]
[CLS] Rate is pretty low . [SEP]
[CLS] But there is a chance that you can meet generous people . [SEP]
[CLS] Take care [SEP]
[CLS] O ##la [SEP]
[CLS] Hi Pat ##y . [SEP]

[CLS] This year is my sixteenth birthday and I 'm going to celebrate at home , with my family and some friends . [SEP]

[CLS] I also went to piriapolis with my family and all the days . [SEP]
[CLS] I went to the beach . We loved it . [SEP]
[CLS] I like English because it is very important to know other languages to communicate with other people and if I go to another country it is very important to know English . [SEP]
[CLS] I think that it is very interesting and I like it . [SEP]
[CLS] Dear pen ##friend , [SEP]
[CLS] Hello , how are you ? [SEP]
[CLS] I hope this letter finds you well . [SEP]
[CLS] I am very well and everything is all right . [SEP]
[CLS] Well , I am writing to tell you about my last summer . [SEP]
[CLS] I had a really nice experience working in a cinema . I would n't have done it if my friend Lucy had n't encouraged me . [SEP]
[CLS] The staff were really interesting and helped me all the time and the customers were kind all the time . [SEP]
[CLS] I learnt lots of things , such as dealing with money and tickets and watched movies for free . [SEP]
[CLS] We got to work at four in the afternoon and it was very relaxing . I had a day off when I spent time at home or going to the gym , where I met handsome guys . [SEP]
[CLS] This summer was really great . [SEP]
[CLS] I recommend you to try this kind of job if you want to earn extra money and also meet new people . [SEP]
[CLS] Lots of hug ##s and kisses . Please write soon [SEP]
[CLS] Love [SEP]
[CLS] G ##iselle [SEP]
[CLS] In this essay I would like to highlight how a wide range of public transport can help people to save a bit of money and a lot of stress ##ful hours stuck in traffic jam ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] First , as everybody knows , the cost of fuel is increasing more and more . adding to that the bills that owning a car will bring , it becomes immediately clear that it is cheaper to get around by public transport . [SEP]
[CLS] Why then are there still so many people who prefer to drive their own car instead of sitting comfortably on the train or on the tube reading their favorite book on their way to work ? [SEP]
[CLS] I would say that this is because the public transport is not so efficient as it should be . [SEP]
[CLS] In my town , for example , I have waited for up to forty minutes before I could get a bus . [SEP]
[CLS] I strongly believe that it is a shame because a lot of people like me would leave their vehicles at home and take a train instead . [SEP]
[CLS] secondly , the environment would improve . As far as I can see , the pollution caused by traffic is ruin ##ing monuments and making the air dirty and heavy , the same is true as far as waste of time is concerned . Obviously , the fewer cars there are around , the quicker you can get where you want to go . [SEP]
[CLS] In conclusion , I would really like politicians who care about public transport to improve the services so that more people could leave their vehicles at home and get around much more easily . [SEP]
[CLS] The problem is that if everyone thinks that traveling by car is convenient , absolutely everyone will go everywhere by car , and the roads will become chockablock . [SEP]
[CLS] You see , man , I do n't like crowded roads , a n ##d prefer to travel by tram . [SEP]
[CLS] It is cheap and el ##o ##quence . [SEP]
[CLS] I have been playing basketball on weekends since I was little . [SEP]
[CLS] I also like to play baseball , too . [SEP]
[CLS] I play basketball and baseball like there is no tomorrow . [SEP]
[CLS] I usually play baseball with a group of my friends . [SEP]
[CLS] I play with them in the playground . [SEP]
[CLS] I ca n't imagine life without sports . [SEP]
[CLS] In today ' s society . [SEP]
[CLS] The most people travel by car , because the public transport is not convenient for people to use . [SEP]
[CLS] Maybe , in fact , the lands are bigger , so that the transport had not published to anywhere . [SEP]
[CLS] The general transport facilities can be divided into three types . [SEP]
[CLS] On the land , the railroad and highway are the path through most city roads . [SEP]
[CLS] On the sea , including the and port facilities . [SEP]
[CLS] In the sky , including airplane flights and airport facilities . [SEP]
[CLS] Transport facilities and economic development have a close relationship , and utilized of land is more important . [SEP]
[CLS] The development of the railroad and highway are easy to pu ##lished , but the construction of sea ##ports and airports must with con ##gen ##ital condition . [SEP]
[CLS] When integration of the economy and land planning are accomplished , the public transport facilities will be convenient for people to use . [SEP]
[CLS] I am going to write about how life is going to change in the next 50 years . [SEP]
[CLS] that every day is a different day if we compare it with the one that has just passed . [SEP]
[CLS] Some years ago , we did n't use technology to get in touch with friends and family , but nowadays it ' s the most important thing for [SEP]
[CLS] some people who ca n't live without it . [SEP]
[CLS] I am speaking about the mobile phone and how it changed our life . [SEP]
[CLS] It ' s normal [SEP]
[CLS] that in the next 50 years it is going to change . [SEP]
[CLS] There will be more advantages in general and it will give us a lot of good things , but maybe some bad things too . [SEP]
[CLS] To sum up , although we do n't want our life to change , it is normal that it will undergo different changes . [SEP]
[CLS] It is necessary for our lives to have or to feel that we are getting better . [SEP]
[CLS] My favourite sport is chess because it is the only game for your mind . [SEP]
[CLS] It also helps us in our studies . [SEP]
[CLS] I agree that it ' s not a physical exercise but a mental one . [SEP]
[CLS] There are many physical exercises , like swimming , but name any game except chess that makes our minds sharp . [SEP]
[CLS] I like many other games , but the best one is this . [SEP]
[CLS] I am not saying that we should always play chess , as physical activities are also important . [SEP]
[CLS] The reason why I would recommend someone this sport is that children who are not interested in their studies or would not be able to study . [SEP]
[CLS] In that case , chess would help him . It would make the child ' s mind sharp and he would not get distracted by his surroundings . [SEP]
[CLS] Local transportation is one of the most serious problems in our area . [SEP]
[CLS] The local transportation has become difficult and expensive , [SEP]
[CLS] so the government must take action to make it easier . [SEP]
[CLS] Public media also must educate people in the importance of local transport and how they can preserve it . [SEP]
[CLS] The government must save gasoline and jazz to solve the problem . [SEP]
[CLS] They must find a solution to this difficult problem . [SEP]
[CLS] They must maintain the roads . [SEP]
[CLS] People also have an important role in solving this problem . [SEP]
[CLS] They should con ##serve energy by using buses instead of using their own cars . [SEP]
[CLS] They can also walk or ride a bike . [SEP]
[CLS] The government must maintain the public transportation and make it safe . [SEP]
[CLS] We can solve this problem if we want to . [SEP]
[CLS] I thought that writing an article on my favourite sport would be interesting for the readers . Above all , and regardless of the sport you have chosen , it is Paramount to do some sport , whatever sport you choose , such as spinning . That is my favourite sport . [SEP]
[CLS] My piece of advice for taking up a hobby , in this case a physical hobby , which is good for your health . [SEP]
[CLS] I rather enjoy spinning , feeling the rhythm of the music louder and louder . This gives me high energy each time I go spinning . [SEP]
[CLS] If you want to start doing some sport , first of all , think about how much time you are willing to spend on it , then try once and if you have a good time , go ahead and make the most of your time enjoying the sport . Nevertheless , be careful and go slowly because you might be injured . [SEP]
[CLS] The more sport you do , the better you feel . Indeed , your mood will not be blue anymore and your body will be thin and gorgeous . [SEP]
[CLS] First of all , my opinion is that there is a future for the public transport systems . [SEP]
[CLS] If we take a look at the Swiss public transport system , in the bigger cities , almost all people go to work by public transport . [SEP]
[CLS] The advantages they get are the following : they do n't have to look for parking possibilities , they can leave the bus or the train and a few minutes after they can begin to work . [SEP]
[CLS] These people also help to protect the environment by saving natural resources like petrol . [SEP]
[CLS] To conclude , in bigger cities like Bern or Zurich there is no doubt that the public transport system would be less inconvenient than travelling by car . [SEP]
[CLS] The process for making bank notes can be outlined in six consecutive steps . [SEP]
[CLS] First , the bank notes are considered how to design , including background colour , artwork and security issues . [SEP]
[CLS] Then , they are prepared by skilled mac ##hin ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] Subsequently , the sheets of bank notes are printed on the metal plates . [SEP]
[CLS] The notes have special ink with colour on both sides , which raises images slightly . [SEP]
[CLS] The most important step is inspect ##ing the notes to see which are good quality sheets and which are bad sheets . [SEP]
[CLS] If the sheets are bad , those sheets are then destroyed by burning . [SEP]
[CLS] Sport is a very important part of a healthy lifestyle . [SEP]
[CLS] It keeps our bodies strong . [SEP]
[CLS] Today we have a lot of different sports , so we can choose something that really suits us . [SEP]
[CLS] I enjoy running . [SEP]
[CLS] It is the kind of thing that anybody can do and it affects all parts of the body . [SEP]
[CLS] I literally feel stronger after every time I run . [SEP]
[CLS] There is no doubt that traffic adds to pollution . [SEP]
[CLS] Public transport offers a possible solution to the problem , because many people can be transported in one vehicle . [SEP]
[CLS] The government has a responsibility to encourage the public to use buses and the underground more . [SEP]
[CLS] However , there are a number of changes that need to be considered . [SEP]
[CLS] firstly , public transport should be made free . [SEP]
[CLS] The government should raise taxes to pay for the service . [SEP]
[CLS] Cars are generally more expensive . [SEP]
[CLS] First , I think public transport is more expensive . [SEP]
[CLS] And if we compare the money you spend on a car and the amount that you spend on public transport , it is less . [SEP]
[CLS] secondly , if you use a car , you do n't have to wait a long time to catch the bus or the train , and maybe you can arrive late for work in this situation . [SEP]
[CLS] I believe that using your car has a lot of advantages or benefits . It is more comfortable and less expensive . [SEP]
[CLS] Last summer I worked at a cinema . I think it is a very good job because you can see any films you like for free . [SEP]
[CLS] The draw ##back of this work is the very big salary and I think that I will work at this cinema next summer . [SEP]
[CLS] My favourite sport is yoga . [SEP]
[CLS] I do yoga to aid relaxation . [SEP]
[CLS] Yoga calm ##s and vital ##izes body and mind . [SEP]
[CLS] I do yoga at least one hour every day . [SEP]
[CLS] From Monday to Friday , I do it at home . At weekends I attend yoga classes . [SEP]
[CLS] Yoga is a very convenient sport . [SEP]
[CLS] We can do it at any time we like . [SEP]
[CLS] But if you are a begin ##ner , it ' s better for you to attend regular yoga classes . [SEP]
[CLS] You can learn correct posture ##s in classes . [SEP]
[CLS] After doing it skill ##fully , you can do it at home or any place . [SEP]
[CLS] People ' s lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years . Equipment and tools have evolved since the beginning of human history . [SEP]
[CLS] In recent decades , however , developments have been particularly groundbreaking . Man has been able to in ##vent machines which have been put to work . automation is a great help to mankind , because it significantly increases the standard of living and free ##s people from hard work . [SEP]
[CLS] The result is much less work and a better life . [SEP]
[CLS] The disadvantage , however , is that , because of the machines , many people have lost their jobs . [SEP]
[CLS] Dear Jo [SEP]
[CLS] I read your letter . I would like to know some details about what places you want to visit . [SEP]
[CLS] I advise you to visit Que ##reta ##ro . It has had an excellent service for foreign people since five years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] Talking about your new job , I was searching for some v ##aca ##ncies . However , they required a full - time worker , so I am going to continue searching for some part - time jobs . [SEP]
[CLS] See you when you arrive in Mexico City [SEP]
[CLS] Since ##rel ##y [SEP]
[CLS] U ##riel [SEP]
[CLS] Is it better to use public transport or private transport ? [SEP]
[CLS] Well , e ##cologist ##s say that getting around using public transport is more beneficial for the environment than using a car or motor ##bi ##ke . [SEP]
[CLS] In recent years , the numbers of people who use public transport has increased a lot , in comparison with ten years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] But does it actually have a future ? [SEP]
[CLS] It ' s more comfortable , faster and prefer ##able to having to run to catch a bus , wait for a train , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] Other signs are , for example , if you travel by car , you can park the car in front of the place where you want to go . [SEP]
[CLS] Also , it has to be said that maybe in the future , technology will create a car that does n't poll ##ute the air , and then , using public transport wo n't be necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] yeah I think this statement is quite right because every person have a car nowadays . [SEP]
[CLS] Transport is important , but a car is more reliable for families if they travel together without waiting for transport . [SEP]
[CLS] It is more flexible and a lot of fun for a family . [SEP]
[CLS] I live in a city named Tang ##eran ##g . It is in Indonesia . [SEP]
[CLS] The Indonesian government itself does n't seem to give a damn about their country ' s clean ##liness , and do neither the citizens . [SEP]
[CLS] This has caused our river some big problems , such as disease , unpleasant smells , floods , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] I myself , seeing the river filled with garbage , always seem to be disgusted by the stench and the unpleasant appearance of the garbage . [SEP]
[CLS] And in Tang ##eran ##g , the air is poll ##uted by carbon dioxide and other chemicals . [SEP]
[CLS] And also , besides the river , the road in the city is also poll ##uted by garbage . [SEP]
[CLS] garbage everywhere . [SEP]
[CLS] The condition of my country is really critical , I think . [SEP]
[CLS] And the amount of the city ' s parks does n't match the amount of the population and pollution in the city . [SEP]
[CLS] There are a lot of high - rise buildings and it causes flooding along the high - rise buildings ' section . [SEP]
[CLS] I wonder if the citizens in my country and town could make a better environment by throwing garbage away in the correct place and trying using e ##co - friendly transportation . [SEP]
[CLS] And government , please do n't be so fl ##abby with your own citizen . [SEP]
[CLS] Yes , be strict . [SEP]
[CLS] I think it ' s okay because the purpose of you doing that is to train the citizens to be more responsible for what they do . And I think that ' s enough from me . [SEP]
[CLS] I suppose the government have also studied this situation . [SEP]
[CLS] But they did n't do that much after finding out this truth . [SEP]
[CLS] I hope the Indonesian government take action regarding this situation because , if it continues , then Indonesia will be the most uncle ##an country over the other countries . [SEP]
[CLS] Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat . [SEP]
[CLS] She looked happy and she was looking forward to finishing the class to tell her friends what had happened . [SEP]
[CLS] After the class , Alison joined her friends . [SEP]
[CLS] She was very enthusiastic and telling them that Juan , the boy who she had fallen in love with , had written a letter to her . [SEP]
[CLS] Then the friends could not fail to pay attention to Alison ' s words . [SEP]
[CLS] She read the letter with a lot of passion , because it was obvious that Juan was interested in Alison too . [SEP]
[CLS] While all the girls were listening to Alison , Juan appeared as a go ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] The boy felt very embarrassed , so he carried on on his way and he did not say anything to her . [SEP]
[CLS] Alison always thought : " If I had not told this story to my friends I would have spent all evening with Juan " [SEP]
[CLS] Like with other things , prices increase , from food to clothes and home supplies , gas , water , electricity . Then people choose public transport in the future . [SEP]
[CLS] My relaxing activity [SEP]
[CLS] Swimming has always been my favourite sport . [SEP]
[CLS] I used to go to the swimming pool when I was at school to learn to swim and it became my favourite activity when I was really tired . [SEP]
[CLS] I was with my sister and my friends and I had a wonderful time . [SEP]
[CLS] Nowadays , I usually go swimming twice a week and I really enjoy swimming because I can chill out and disco ##nne ##ct my mind . [SEP]
[CLS] Moreover , it is said to be healthy and improve ##s problems with the back , so going swimming is really beneficial for me . [SEP]
[CLS] Recently , I found a g ##ad ##get to listen to music while I am swimming and it is marvellous because I also love listening to music . [SEP]
[CLS] For begin ##ners in this sport I would recommend that a trainer teaches swimming properly because it is very important to pay attention to the position of the arms . [SEP]
[CLS] Furthermore , it is necessary to wear glasses . [SEP]
[CLS] Swimming is one of the best sports to do because it requires all parts of the body . [SEP]
[CLS] For this reason , it is a perfect activity to do sport and enjoy yourself . [SEP]
[CLS] There are lots of problems in our life . [SEP]
[CLS] For example , transport . [SEP]
[CLS] There are lots of kinds of transportation like buses , cars , subway ##s , trains or ta ##ix ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] May Maybe they are comfortable , terrible , , dangerous or average . [SEP]
[CLS] If you are late , you can use the subway because it is faster , safer and ch ##eep ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] Cars and buses become dangerous and cause problems in the street . [SEP]
[CLS] My view of eating habits . [SEP]
[CLS] Why does our brain think about food every day ? [SEP]
[CLS] Why do we have a fridge in every single home ? [SEP]
[CLS] Why . . . . . ? [SEP]
[CLS] Every day people think about fresh food , fast food , sweet food and many different types of food . Why ? [SEP]
[CLS] Are you thinking that emotional eating is your bad habit ? [SEP]
[CLS] How often do you open your fridge ? [SEP]
[CLS] How many times do you go shopping for some snack ##s ? [SEP]
[CLS] What happened to us ? [SEP]
[CLS] I remember that my childhood was very quiet and happy around dinner at grandmother ' s house . [SEP]
[CLS] Really , I tell you that I was , like , a little bit future girl who has dinner regularly with two portions : soup and meal deal . [SEP]
[CLS] So we can start from the beginning : first , was breakfast , which included some cereal ##s with hot milk . [SEP]
[CLS] Second , was lunch at school with something like a sandwich and some fruit . [SEP]
[CLS] Later I was at home at dinner time and had some dessert . [SEP]
[CLS] Can you see how easy and regular a life I have got . [SEP]
[CLS] My " private menu " included fresh food like salad , fish , fruit and vegetables - many options and healthy food . [SEP]
[CLS] Now , I am a 28 - year - old woman who does n't have time for normal dinner because I 'm very busy . [SEP]
[CLS] Today , I wake up at 07 . 00 ##am and grab some kind of bread with jam , drink a coffee , but more often than not , just have time for half a mug and run to work . [SEP]
[CLS] During the day , I have lunch , which is from a can or order some junk food . [SEP]
[CLS] Later , I order take away from a Chinese b ##uff ##et or a pizza . [SEP]
[CLS] When the weekend comes , I have a plan for a special dinner which is home made , but do n't have time again . [SEP]
[CLS] What happened to my healthy life which I wanted to have when I was a child ? [SEP]
[CLS] Why does everything look more difficult and harder than it was before ? [SEP]
[CLS] Where is our free time and what are you doing with your lifestyle ? [SEP]
[CLS] Ten years showed me that I can do everything for myself if it is enough for me . . . . [SEP]
[CLS] Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat . [SEP]
[CLS] She went to the train station and got a ticket to London . [SEP]
[CLS] She stood there and read the note again . The address was near to Big Ben . [SEP]
[CLS] When the train came she smiled and got on and sat down . [SEP]
[CLS] She turned her head and saw him . " He was following me " , she thought . " Well , I should ask him what he is doing here " . [SEP]
[CLS] " What are you doing here " asked Alison . He looked at her but with a bad smile , and turn his head . [SEP]
[CLS] First of all , finishing high school is a rite of passage that indicates the beginning of a new chapter for students . [SEP]
[CLS] From this moment , they will have maturity and responsibility . [SEP]
[CLS] However , many of them are not ready for this . [SEP]
[CLS] So , a lot of parents and students have the opportunity to travel for a year . [SEP]
[CLS] When you are travelling around the world by yourself , you gain a lot of knowledge , culture , discoveries and , with all of this , you gain personal experience . [SEP]
[CLS] Sometimes , this can change a person , making her or him have a new perception of the world . [SEP]
[CLS] However , some students do n't have this opportunity to travel ; they start to work . [SEP]
[CLS] The job provides , like the trip , responsibility and experience . [SEP]
[CLS] It changes the person in a different way too . [SEP]
[CLS] The consequences are n't good as the reasons , for instance , they may have the career pre ##ju ##dicate , or they spend so many years travelling that they are too old to study at a university . [SEP]
[CLS] Besides that , they have different points of view on many subjects , that is why they may not like the fun and the conversation in the social life with other students . [SEP]
[CLS] They can not enjoy this chapter with young and fresh thoughts . [SEP]
[CLS] Finally , to make a decision to not go to a university when you finish high school is n't the e ##asi ##est action to take . [SEP]
[CLS] It is a big decision , that brings great consequences and great experiences . [SEP]
[CLS] Whatever the choice is , it will leave a mark on their lives forever . [SEP]
[CLS] Be careful and choose well . [SEP]
[CLS] Public transport is the backbone of a city . [SEP]
[CLS] Usually people use public transport to travel around the city . [SEP]
[CLS] If in a city people use public transport more than their own private vehicle , then it will help to protect the environment and ease traffic as well . [SEP]
[CLS] But nowadays , automobile companies are more focused on the improvement of cars so that they can be more environmental ##ly friendly and traffic friendly . [SEP]
[CLS] The future of public transport will be measured on the basis of the advancement of the private vehicle . [SEP]
[CLS] Sometimes people get offended because of the crowd and the inconvenience caused by some people while using public transport . [SEP]
[CLS] But the main concern will be technology . [SEP]
[CLS] Technology is becoming more advanced . [SEP]
[CLS] A car is being made that is so e ##co - friendly and user - friendly that it is more [SEP]
[CLS] Many people say that , at school , all students have to start a sport and do it regularly . [SEP]
[CLS] It is not a good idea because some students have to study all afternoon for other subjects and free time is very scan ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] As an example , if a student needs to recuperate a subject or has to get a good mark , they ca n't go to do a sport because there is no time . [SEP]
[CLS] In contrast , doing a sport is very important because we can make new friends or we can start to take responsibility , but the most important thing is that we are always active so our body can get good results . [SEP]
[CLS] To sum up , doing sports is very important for teenagers , whose bodies are growing , and doing it regularly is a commitment that we should make . In my opinion , however , doing a mandatory sport is not educational because we must do a sport with enthusiasm , not bothered or out of obligation . [SEP]
[CLS] Dear Sir , [SEP]
[CLS] I 'm writing with regard to the watch fossil FS4735 , which is similar to FS4812 but with different colours . [SEP]
[CLS] I saw it a couple of days ago and I was going to buy it , but it has disappeared from your [SEP]
[CLS] products list ( I suppose it has been sold out ) . [SEP]
[CLS] However , I wonder if you could tell me when it [SEP]
[CLS] will be available again ? [SEP]
[CLS] Thank you in advance for the information . [SEP]
[CLS] Yours faithful ##ly [SEP]
[CLS] In my opinion , they are not my friends . If your parents were your friends , you would live in harmony with them . [SEP]
[CLS] They would consider you as an independent person . [SEP]
[CLS] Accordingly , you would take responsibility for what you did . [SEP]
[CLS] However , they are not my friends . [SEP]
[CLS] There are some reasons why they are not , as follows . [SEP]
[CLS] First of all , I make every effort to do my job better , but , they only consider that I waste my time doing the wrong thing . [SEP]
[CLS] Next , they do n't believe my skills are good . [SEP]
[CLS] I do everything , but nothing . [SEP]
[CLS] Finally , they totally do n't listen to what my point is . [SEP]
[CLS] They always look at me like I 'm a kid who never grew up . [SEP]
[CLS] It is ridiculous that my parents do n't believe in my ability . [SEP]
[CLS] I am overwhelmed with grief , living with them . [SEP]
[CLS] I can not tolerate their pride and prejudice anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] I prefer being alone to living with them . [SEP]
[CLS] People often discuss if TV viewing is useful for education . [SEP]
[CLS] In my opinion , watching TV is actually helpful for learning new things . [SEP]
[CLS] There is one argument that says that the TV promotes us . [SEP]
[CLS] The main reason for this is that TV teaches us , because it is an important medium in our lives . [SEP]
[CLS] This clearly shows that TV is teaching . [SEP]
[CLS] To sum up , TV viewing is not just entertaining at all ; It is definitely also ed ##uca ##ting . [SEP]
[CLS] Many people argue about the use of TV . [SEP]
[CLS] Some of them believe that it can only entertain us , while others believe that it can also educate . [SEP]
[CLS] However , I think that TV can do both . [SEP]
[CLS] I bet if somebody wants to have some fun , he or she can just choose the right Channel or movie , such as comedies , video gag ##s or funny TV shows . [SEP]
[CLS] Meanwhile , if an individual wants to learn from TV , [SEP]
[CLS] TV provides lots of cognitive programs , like cooking , taking care of pets , how to eat well . [SEP]
[CLS] For me , I do prefer reality shows that help people with how to deal with problems . [SEP]
[CLS] Football is the favourite sport in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] It was invented by a talented athlete in the UK in early 1900 . The sport became very famous from when the first World Cup was held in Uruguay until the present . [SEP]
[CLS] I have really enjoyed watching and playing football since I was a kid . [SEP]
[CLS] There are several reasons why people really enjoy soccer so much . [SEP]
[CLS] Nothing is permanent in this world . I 've heard these words from the mouths of my parents and now it is in my heart and helps me to deal with this kind of life . [SEP]
[CLS] Life is changing very fast as the days on the calendar are going by , the flow of life continuously re ##volving with the world every person has . [SEP]
[CLS] Nobody can tell how , when , where and what will happen in the next 50 years of our lives . [SEP]
[CLS] It depends on how you deal with what you have in the present to be prepared for the forthcoming changes in the future . [SEP]
[CLS] There are a lot of factors that could greatly affect what you will be in the next 50 years of your life . [SEP]
[CLS] But the most vital part for these changes is you . [SEP]
[CLS] Everybody has the right one for a change , but it should be for the better and not for the worse . [SEP]
[CLS] With the simultaneous growing inventions of technologies , way of living go through with it . [SEP]
[CLS] A complicated ways from before , advanced technologies make it easy and simple now , what else more could we expect ? [SEP]
[CLS] The digital age has been a big problem for the music industry because the new technologies and the internet have helped music p ##iracy . [SEP]
[CLS] The people already do not buy a CD , they simply download it . [SEP]
[CLS] " Pi ##racy is destroying the music industry " as it is a violation of copyright . [SEP]
[CLS] It is a shame that a person works for many months people want to enjoy his work without having to pay ; it is literally stealing . [SEP]
[CLS] It is like you designing a chair and people taking it without paying . [SEP]
[CLS] Singers have to adapt and be able to survive p ##iracy . Now most of their income is from concerts and digital platforms like Spot ##ify . [SEP]
[CLS] I think that people should be more responsible and respect the work of others so that society evolve ##s in a healthy way and without conflicts . [SEP]
[CLS] Today , many people , groups or social movements disagree with different and mainly aspects of our dominant culture . For example , marriage or the age for marriage , the role of women in the family , religions , education and new types of family and many values . [SEP]
[CLS] This perspective on life is inspired by counter - culture movements and some people call these people " alternative " , but they are more common each day and this creates an inclusive and diverse society . [SEP]
[CLS] The culture is changing in this way . Maybe it could be wonderful for human freedom . [SEP]
[CLS] Changes IN Colombian Culture [SEP]
[CLS] eating habits in my country have really changed in the last ten years . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s r is n't clear completely , but I suppose it depends on changing life habits in the development process of our society . [SEP]
[CLS] The first and most important change is related to eating prepared food that is n't healthy . Usually , the reason is probably women ' s lifestyle ##s , which are going through big changes in the sense that they do n't like staying at home and spending their time making food . Now they prefer to buy prepared food . [SEP]
[CLS] The other issue is related to our habit of eating food together with our family , which was a custom in human life , not just in our culture , but now because of a hard and busy life , we had to eat our meals most days of the week . [SEP]
[CLS] Now , we forget big dinner tables that are surrounded by family members . [SEP]
[CLS] But a good change in our habits is the attention to ca ##lor ##ies and healthy food , because of getting information on the internet and other media that are easily accessible for all people these days . [SEP]
[CLS] In summary , l think the change is ne ##gli ##gible but we can control it to make our life better , especially in relation to food , which is the most important aspect of our life but we do n't pay attention to it enough . [SEP]
[CLS] I am a programmer who wants to write about programming languages and skills . [SEP]
[CLS] The truth of the matter is I think I 'm full of ideas but , unfortunately , I ca n't describe my knowledge and experiences in English . [SEP]
[CLS] However , I can write these ideas in my own native language and that ' s why I 'm thinking that one day I should be able to write those ideas in English as well . [SEP]
[CLS] Dear Sophie , I have just come back from a really exciting few days with my cousin . [SEP]
[CLS] That was the best place I have ever been . [SEP]
[CLS] We went to New York for four days . [SEP]
[CLS] On Thursday , we arrived at 12 . 15 . [SEP]
[CLS] While I was in the bathroom , my cousin was smoking . [SEP]
[CLS] When I went back , a policeman asked him not to smoke , so he was angry for the whole flight . [SEP]
[CLS] On Friday , we went on an incredible sights ##ee ##ing tour , but the guide told me not to take pictures because I had to buy them . [SEP]
[CLS] On Saturday night , we went to a formal restaurant to eat past ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] Finally , we departed at 18 . 45 pm . [SEP]
[CLS] I think I will go back next year . [SEP]
[CLS] It was a well planned holiday . [SEP]
[CLS] Michael , together with his two friends , Adam and John , decided to take a vacation in P ##ula ##u Lang ##ka ##wi , Ke ##dah , Malaysia . [SEP]
[CLS] They searched for flight tickets , rental car , and hotel . [SEP]
[CLS] They were very excited and could n't wait to go there . [SEP]
[CLS] About one month before departure , they researched on the internet the places that might interest them . [SEP]
[CLS] There were Pa ##dan ##g Mat ##sir ##at , Cable Car , Ma ##hs ##uri Tomb , small islands , Duck tour , beaches , shopping centre and , the most exciting thing was buying chocolate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] One day before going , Michael suddenly had a problem . [SEP]
[CLS] He needed to follow his family to the town . [SEP]
[CLS] With all his hurt heart , he told his two friends about the matter . [SEP]
[CLS] Adam and John were very angry . [SEP]
[CLS] They said they had already planned everything and Michael had happily ruined the vacation . [SEP]
[CLS] They needed to think again about the budget and all of the other stuff . [SEP]
[CLS] Michael could n't stand anymore . He s ##co ##lded his friends and said something that no one would want to hear . [SEP]
[CLS] His mother heard what had happened . [SEP]
[CLS] She tried to have a calm talk with her son in his room . [SEP]
[CLS] She said money can cause everyone pain if it is not settled very well . [SEP]
[CLS] After all the wise advice , his mother kissed him on his forehead . [SEP]
[CLS] Michael tried to think wise ##ly again . [SEP]
[CLS] He accompanied his mother to his room ' s door . [SEP]
[CLS] Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake . [SEP]
[CLS] He called his friends back and managed to sort out the mess . [SEP]
[CLS] Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he had forgotten what he had to do . After thinking , he remembered that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her in his car as the doctor ' s clinic was far away from her house . Peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother ' s house in the next street . After he arrived , he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the street . He apologized to her and asked her to get into the car . " Never mind " she said and got in the car beside him . [SEP]
[CLS] she was absolutely fine . [SEP]
[CLS] There is a man who is the most important in everyone ' s life . [SEP]
[CLS] I am not different in that . There is a backs ##tai ##rs influence in my life . He is none other than my father . [SEP]
[CLS] I respect him so much and admire him also . [SEP]
[CLS] He is my best friend who never hurts me . [SEP]
[CLS] He always helps me by giving good advice . [SEP]
[CLS] He is an ideal farmer who never ever tells a lie . [SEP]
[CLS] His means of making a live ##lihood is the simplest . [SEP]
[CLS] He always honors the oldest and taught us to avoid telling a lie . As far as I remember , one day he was advising me when suddenly an old man entered the conversation and gave a foolish speech . [SEP]
[CLS] Nevertheless , my father did n't tell him arrogant ##ly but he made him know the right thing politely . [SEP]
[CLS] He is a fluent speaker . [SEP]
[CLS] That ' s why I admire him . [SEP]
[CLS] Everyone makes mistakes . No one can say I have not made any mistakes in my life . [SEP]
[CLS] I have made many mistakes I guess . [SEP]
[CLS] But is that a big problem in our lives or a small problem , or does it really not matter ? [SEP]
[CLS] Or do you really regret what you have done ? [SEP]
[CLS] travelling by car plays an important role in our lives . [SEP]
[CLS] There is a lot of private transport in the streets . [SEP]
[CLS] However , travelling by bus or tram never get away from our daily routine . travelling by bus is not as convenient as getting in a car , but you can never know what might happen with your car , where it might get stuck in traffic or some other accident might happen . [SEP]
[CLS] Public transport has a timetable . [SEP]
[CLS] This fact gives the government the opportunity to manage the traffic on the roads in cities or towns . [SEP]
[CLS] Private transport gives us traffic jam ##s , a lot of accidents and stress ##ful situations . [SEP]
[CLS] We get nervous because we are responsible not only for our lives but for other people ' s , too . [SEP]
[CLS] And , also , we have to understand that using public transport is cheaper than using a car . [SEP]
[CLS] The other side of the problem is ecological . [SEP]
[CLS] Why do we think that only convenience can be the main point of using a car ? [SEP]
[CLS] What can we say about our ecological awareness ? [SEP]
[CLS] Let ' s take a bicycle to travel to our school or job instead of using any public or private transport . [SEP]
[CLS] Transport is very important for our lives . [SEP]
[CLS] Public transport will have no future because travelling by car is more convenient . [SEP]
[CLS] Public transport is not suitable for luggage . [SEP]
[CLS] Travel plans need to depend on public transport timetable ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] It is more fun when we travel by car . [SEP]
[CLS] We can play music or talk about anything while we travel in a car . [SEP]
[CLS] Public transport is more boring . [SEP]
[CLS] If there is no public transport in some areas , then we need to hire a taxi . [SEP]
[CLS] So , If we have our own car , it is much easier than using public transport . [SEP]
[CLS] Dear Jo , [SEP]
[CLS] How are you ? [SEP]
[CLS] Nice to receive your letter and learn that you will be in Hong Kong this summer . [SEP]
[CLS] Hong Kong is a wonderful place for shopping , eating and sight - seeing . [SEP]
[CLS] You can taste sea - food in Sai Kung and Abe ##ede ##en . [SEP]
[CLS] visit Big Bud ##da on Lam ##ma Island , see the beautiful night view on the Peak . [SEP]
[CLS] Besides , Hong Kong also has many country parks for hiking . [SEP]
[CLS] I am sure that you will love this country ! [SEP]
[CLS] If you want to find a job for only three months , I suggest you could teach English for a summer school . [SEP]
[CLS] In Hong Kong , most students would like to take some courses in the summer holidays . [SEP]
[CLS] I will get some information for you if you are interested in that . [SEP]
[CLS] write to me when you have fixed your it ##iner ##ary , and looking forward to seeing you in Hong Kong . [SEP]
[CLS] Ta [SEP]
[CLS] I think public transport is Paramount nowadays , but the future will bring us some kind of different means of transport , such as the car . Yes , the car we have been using all our lives . [SEP]
[CLS] But this time , it will be another story , because in order to save time and money , we are going to use our own cars . [SEP]
